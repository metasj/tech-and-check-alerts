# Tech & Check Alerts

A system that sends out a daily tip sheet for fact checkers, developed at the Duke Reporters Lab.

## Installation instructions
This is a node project, to set up your development environment...

### Install dependencies

```
> yarn install
```

### Set up postgres

This project uses [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) to store its data.  You will need to either set up a local copy, or find a hosted solution.

### Set up redis

This project uses [redis](https://redis.io/) as a data store for queues.  You will need to set up a local copy, or find a hosted solution.

### Configure the project

You will need to configure your environment variables.  In production this can be done however your host recommends; in development we recommend using an .env file.

The environment variables used in this project are:

* DATABASE_URL_PRODUCTION :: The full database url to be used in production.
* DATABASE_URL_DEVELOPMENT :: The full database url to be used in development.
* DATABASE_URL_TEST :: The full database url to be used in testing.
* REDIS_URL :: The redis url to be used.

Database urls will look something like `postgresql://username:password@localhost/dbname`

A template for the contents of `.env` is provided in `.env.example`.

```
> cp .env.example .env
> vi .env
```

### Run Migrations

```
> yarn migrate
```

### Start the service

```
> yarn start
```

## Queues

The primary control flow of this project is handled through jobs and queues.  We use [bull](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bull), which is built on top of redis.

Creating a new queue involves making a new directory in the `server/queues` folder with the following files:

* Job Processor :: The job processor is the code that is run whenever a new item (job) is added to the queue.  It takes in job information, does work, and registers the completion of the job. This must export a function that will be called on a job process.
* Job Scheduler :: The job scheduler determines how often jobs are regularly added to this queue.  The possible frequency constants are described in `src/server/queues/constants.js`.  This file must export a class that extends AbstractJobScheduler.
* Queue Factory :: The queue factory points to the processor file and names the queue.  This must export a class that extends AbstractQueueFactory.
* index (aka the "Queue Dict") :: This just returns instantiated versions of the components decribed in this list.  This must export an object with factory, scheduler, and processor attributes.

The best thing to do is look at an existing implemented queue and work from there.
